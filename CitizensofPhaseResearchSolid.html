				<h2>Solids</h2>
				<p>Solids are known for keeping its shape. Their ability keeps the same shape is because the molecules in a solid stay in place and vibrate. Unlike a liquid or gas, solids aren't flexible although with outside force, some solids can easily change its shape. Itâ€™s tough, sturdy, and rigid nature makes it the strongest out of all the phases of matter. Even when crushed to bits, the molecules will still keep its structure. Solids such as sand act like a liquid because of the air between the individual sand grains. When looking at the individual sand gains, they act like a solid.</p>
